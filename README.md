**Task 1: Dynamic Input and String Manipulation**

This repository contains a Python program that performs various string manipulation tasks based on dynamic input. The program reads a string statement from the command line and accomplishes the following tasks:

- Adds exception handling wherever necessary.
- Determines the total number of characters present in the statement.
- Calculates the total number of duplicate characters in the statement.
- Counts the total number of words present in the statement.
- Identifies the total number of duplicate words in the statement.
- Reverses the characters present in the statement.
- Reverses the words present in the statement.
- Forms a new statement from the reversed words.
- Removes duplicate characters from the latest statement.
- Prints the final latest string statement.

The program ensures that all inputs are dynamic, preventing the use of static input. Each task is uniquely implemented, and the program is designed to be explanatory through its code.

To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Maryterralogic/Python_mesia.git
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory:
cd Python_mesia
3. Add your Python file to the staging area:
git add string_function.py
4. Commit your changes:
git commit -m "Initial commit"
5. Push your changes to the remote repository's branch (replace `ramp_up_python_mesia` with the appropriate branch name):
git push origin ramp_up_python_mesia
6. Execute the Python program in the terminal, providing the required input as prompted:
python .\string_function.py

**Task 2:Email Validation:**

1.Clone the repository or copy the provided Python code into a .py file on your local machine.
2.Run the program using a Python interpreter:
  python email_validator.py
3.The program will prompt you to enter an email address for validation.
4.If the email address is valid based on the regular expression, the program will store it in a file named email_list.txt.
5.The program will continue to prompt for email addresses until you choose to exit.
6.If you choose to exit by typing "No" or "exit", the program will display a list of email IDs stored in the file.
Features:
- Validates email addresses using a regular expression pattern.
- Stores valid email addresses in a file for later retrieval.
- Provides options to continue or exit the validation process.
- Displays a list of stored email IDs when the user decides to exit.
